# Keystroke logging attacks 
  Keystroke logging, often called keylogging or keyboard capturing, is a common computer-based social engineering attack of recording the keys struck while a person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored.  Keyloggers are often used for nefarious means, like spying on a user to steal sensitive data such as their usernames and passwords by seeing the target type it themselves. Data such as user password, login, or bank details can then be retrieved by the person operating the logging program.
We will see how easy it is to record users’ keystrokes in these exercises.
	 
 ## AirDrive Forensic Keylogger Pro – USB
 The AirDrive Forensic Keylogger pack contains just the Keylogger itself (shown below), which has a male and female USB port. A female port is the receiver side, and the male side is the connector. The device acts as a WiFi access point you can connect to, with either a computer, smartphone, laptop, etc. While connected, you will receive a constant live stream of strokes the keyboard is typing. The device only works with external USB keyboards as the device has to be plugged inline between the keyboard and PC; hence it does not work with inbuilt keyboards like laptops or a computer desktop.
