## Tips 
* Anyone who makes threats against you on the internet may be breaking the law. Using the phone system, which includes the internet, to cause alarm or distress is illegal in the United Kingdom.
* If you make derogatory remarks about someone online or convey threats, the authorities can easily track you out. Your internet service provider keeps an electronic record of every time you visit a website or make a posting.

* Once you send a message, video or image of yourself, be aware that it can easily get into the wrong hands.
* Once an image is on the internet, it can be copied by anyone and even appear on sexual chat sites and forums.
### Sexting law
