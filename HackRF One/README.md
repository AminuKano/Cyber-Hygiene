# What is Social Engineering ?

Social engineering is a technique that allows an attacker to get beyond technical controls by attacking an organization's human element. When successful, a social engineering attack almost always leads to some level of compromise. Because they rely on human variables, social engineering attacks are both easy to commit and difficult to defend against.

Cybercriminals frequently target businesses and individuals via emails that appear to come from a genuine bank, government agency, or organisation. The sender of these emails instructs recipients to click on a link that will lead them to a page where they can validate personal information, account information, and other details.
