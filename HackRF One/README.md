# What is Social Engineering ?

Social engineering is a technique that allows an attacker to get beyond technical controls by attacking an organization's human element. When successful, a social engineering attack almost always leads to some level of compromise. Because they rely on human variables, social engineering attacks are both easy to commit and difficult to defend against.

Cybercriminals frequently target businesses and individuals via emails that appear to come from a genuine bank, government agency, or organisation. The sender of these emails instructs recipients to click on a link that will lead them to a page where they can validate personal information, account information, and other details.

## Types of Scoal Engineering ##
Social engineering techniques include, but are not limited to, Trojan and phishing email messages, impersonation, persuasion, bribery, shoulder surfing, and dumpster diving, among others.

* **Trojan email or phishing attacks** can be used to collect personal information, system credentials, or even compromise a user's operating system's security by installing malicious backdoor applications that give the attacker complete access to the machine.

* **Impersonation** There are multiple types of impersonation techniques that a social engineer can use. Attackers often
conduct impersonation attacks by telephone calling

* **Persuasion and Bribery**   In persuasion attacks, the social engineer will attempt to trick a person through various methods to divulge critical information or assist the attack in some other means.

* **Shoulder Surfing** Shoulder surfing occurs when an attacker peers over an unwary user's shoulder as she enters her user name and password.
