* The social engineering (SE) attack is manipulating the target (a person) to obtain information by a social engineer – an attacker.

* Social Engineering is the most superior form of Cyber attacks attacks as users themselves are the attacks’ targets.

* The attacker can execute the attack in person by interacting with the target to gather desired information about the target(s) or use specialised software.

to address the problem of human weaknesses.

### Because they rely on human variables, social engineering attacks are both easy to commit and difficult to defend against.
