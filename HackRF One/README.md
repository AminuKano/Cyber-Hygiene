# What is Social Engineering ?
* A social engineering (SE) attack is when an attacker tries to manipulate a target to obtain information.

* Social engineering attacks are some of the strongest cyber attacks, as they target the weakest link - the user.

* An attacker can execute a SE attack either in person, by interacting with the target to gather desired information, or use specialised software.

###  A distinctive feature of SE attacks compared with other forms of attacks, is that social engineering attacks exploit human weaknesses and hence it is difficult to address the problem of human weaknesses.

### Because they rely on human variables, social engineering attacks are both easy to commit and difficult to defend against.

# Attackers that use SE attacks can be classified into two main categories; social (or human)-based and computer-based attacks
