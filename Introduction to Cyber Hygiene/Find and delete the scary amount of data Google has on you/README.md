Google collects a frightening amount of data about you. You can find and delete it now. Chances are, Google knows your name, your face, your birthday, gender, other email addresses you use, your password and phone number. Some of this is listed as public information (not your password, of course). Here's how to see what Google shares with the world about you.

* Open a browser window and navigate to your Google Account page http://myaccount.google.com/
* Type your Google username (with or without "@gmail.com").
* Choose Personal info from the menu bar and review the information. You can change or delete your photo, name, birthday, gender, password, other emails and phone number.
* If you'd like to see what information of yours is available publicly, scroll to the bottom and select Go to About me.
* To take a look at Google's record of your online activity, do the following:
  - Choose Data & Personalization from the navigation bar.
  - To see a list of all your activity that Google has logged, scroll to Activity controls and select Web & App Activity. This is where all your Google searches, YouTube viewing history, Google Assistant commands and other interactions with Google apps and services get recorded.
  - To turn it completely off, move the toggle to the off position. 
iv.	If you want Google to stop tracking just your Chrome browser history and activity from sites you sign into with your Google account, uncheck the first box.
v.	To set Google to automatically delete this kind of data either never or every three or 18 months, select Auto-delete and pick the time frame you feel most comfortable with. Select Delete or Confirm your auto delete settings.
vi.	Next, click Manage Activity. This page displays all the information Google has collected on you from the activities mentioned in the previous steps, arranged by date, all the way back to the day you created your account or the last time you purged this list.
vii.	To delete specific days, select the trash can icon to the right of the day then choose Got it. To get more specific details or to delete individual items, select the three stacked dots icon beside the item then choose either Delete or Details.
viii.	Check and confirm if your new settings took effects.
