# What is Cyber Hygiene - 30 minutes?
Cyber hygiene is the practice of using computer systems and other technological devices to maintain computer system health, keep data safe, well-protected, and improve online security. This could involve a routine to ensure identity safety – such as using different passwords for each account or just having a general awareness of the potential threats while using the technology. 

Having good cyber hygiene is important not only to maintain the health of your system, making it run quickly and smoothly, but also to protect it from nefarious means such as viruses, malware, and other malicous attacks trying to hurt the system. Cyber hygiene is also important to protect the users from hackers and thieves trying to access things such as your data, social media, or vital accounts such as banking.

**Online fraud** is negatively affecting the lives of people both financially and psychologically, due to the losses victims of such crime are facing. Sometimes victims of online fraud suffer beyond financial loss, for example, also suffering from depression, frustration, or can even commit suicide.

# Common Cyber Hygiene Problems
* Insufficient education
* Weak password usage and storage 
* Cybercriminals love Online Sharers
* Security breach, attacks from hackers through phishing, hacking, malware, spam, or viruses could cost loss of accounts or data
* having out of date software

# What Can We Do To Protect Ourselves?
The good news is that there are things we can do to improve our Cyber hygien 
* Employ extra protection across all your devices.
* Think before you post on social media 
* Clean-up your digital past
* Never reuse passwords
* Avoid Sharing Personal Information Online
* Improve your privacy and security settings
* Avoid using public WIFI

# Good Practices for Cyber Hygiene

* Keep software up to date. Keeping software up to date means it is always ready to deal with the latest threats and any exploits will have been patched.

* Use secure passwords/password managers. Avoid using common or easy to guess passwords means you’re less likely to be vulnerable to brute force attacks. 

* Make regular backups of data. In the case of data being lost or corrupted it can always be recovered from a backup.

* Avoid accessing public Wi-Fi. Remember, whenever you connect your device to the Internet, you are at the mercy of the network owner. The person who owns the internet gateway can successfully filter your internet traffic and subsequently exploit your device through different forms of attacks.

* Verify the wireless connection. Do not just rely on names of addresses, some bogus links, that have been set up by malicious users, will have a connection name that’s deliberately similar to the coffee shop, hotel or venue that’s offering free Wi-Fi.

* Avoid using specific types of websites, when using public Wi-Fi. It’s a good idea to avoid logging onto websites where cybercriminals could capture your identity, passwords or personal information — such as social networking sites, online banking services or any websites that store your credit card information. 

# Strong Password #
Millions of passwords were compiled into a dataset to discover the top 200 most often used passwords worldwide in 2021 by a password management service called [NordPass](https://nordpass.com/most-common-passwords-list/).

* Secure passwords are difficult for others to guess or for computers intended for this purpose to crack.
* Password's cracking entails a computer doing a brute force attack on a large number of password combinations until it discovers the one that is your password. Passwords that are simple and widely used are easily cracked.

## Findings ##
Accoeding to [NordPass](https://nordpass.com/most-common-passwords-list/) 2021 report.

1. Most common passwords globally are: 
* 123456
* 123456789
* 12345
* qwerty
* password
* 12345678
* 111111
* 123123
* 1234567890
* 1234567

2. Password choices are often attached to cultural preferences. For example,
 
* In the UK, “liverpool” was the third most popular password, with 224,160 hits
* In Chile,the name of Chilean football club “colocolo” was used by 15,748 people - making it the fifth most common choice
* “christ” was the 19th most common password used in Nigeria, used 7,169 times
* “bismillah”, an Arabic phrase meaning in the name of Allah, was used by 1,599 people in Saudi Arabia – the 30th most common choice.


## Activity 1.1 - How secure is my password? ## 
Aim - to learn which password combinations are the hardest to guess or crack.

* Launch this site to see [How Secure is your Password?](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/) 
* Enter a password of your choice to see the result.
* Begin to use increasingly complex passwords (length and variation of characters) and see how the time frame changes. 
* For example, try the following passwords:
   - chocolate
   - chocolatemilkshake
   - Ch0c0l@t3
   - Ch0c0l@t3M1lksh@k3!
   
Based on this activity, do you see the need to change your password? 

## Activity 1.2 - Design the strongest passphrase ##

* Write an easy-to-remember statement. This could be a lyric from a song or a scene from a movie, a narrative about a place you've visited, or any other phrase you recall. See the following example.
  - The cat is Milo and the dog is Otis
  - Now, take the first letter from each word to make your password (including capitalisation). E.g. TciMatdiO
  - Change the letters to numbers and symbols where possible. E.g. Tc1M&td10
  - You Can also add a symbol on the end for extra length and complexity. E.g. Tc1M&td10!

* Use the link [How Secure Is My Password?](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/) to see how secure the password you created is? 


## Activity 1.3- Checking if your email has been a part of a data breach ##

Sometimes your own secuirty can only do so much. One growing concern, in the realm of cyber hygiene, is more and more companies have had their databases breached; stealing all their userbases account details and data. From these details, hackers will use the breached data and attempt to sign into other services using the same details (hoping users will use the same details for multiple accounts) – hence it is important to use different passwords and enable two-factor authentication on all accounts.

The following site will show if your email address has been apart of any data breaches

* Simply type your email address in the [this link](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)  and click the 'pwned?' key to check if any of your email addresses have been a part of data breaches. 
* If need be, make a note of, or consider changing passwords to any accounts that have been breached and also consider changing the passwords of any accounts that shared those login details.
* In the future, always consider enabling two-factor authentication and use different passwords for each account (perhaps consider a password manage to remember and create many strong passwords).
