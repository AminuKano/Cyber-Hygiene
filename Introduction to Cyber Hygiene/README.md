# What is Cyber Hygiene ?
* Cyber hygiene is the practice of using computer systems and other technological devices to maintain computer system health, keep data safe, well-protected, and improve online security. 

* This could involve a routine to ensure identity safety, data integrity and confidentiality, having a general awareness of the potential threats while using the technology, etc. 

* Having good cyber hygiene is important not only to maintain the health of your system, making it run quickly and smoothly, but also to protect it from nefarious means such as viruses, malware, and other malicous attacks trying to hurt the system. 

* Cyber hygiene is also important to protect the users from hackers and thieves trying to access things such as your data, social media, or vital accounts such as banking.

**Online fraud** is negatively affecting the lives of people both financially and psychologically, due to the losses victims of such crime are facing. Sometimes victims of online fraud suffer beyond financial loss, for example, also suffering from depression, frustration, or can even commit suicide.

# Common Cyber Hygiene Problems
* Insufficient education
* Weak password usage and storage 
* Cybercriminals love Online Sharers
* Security breach, attacks from hackers through phishing, hacking, malware, spam, or viruses could cost loss of accounts or data
* having out of date software

# Strong Password #
Millions of passwords were compiled into a dataset to discover the top 200 most often used passwords worldwide in 2021 by a password management service called [NordPass](https://nordpass.com/most-common-passwords-list/).

* Secure passwords are difficult for others to guess or for computers intended for this purpose to crack.
* Password's cracking entails a computer doing a brute force attack on a large number of password combinations until it discovers the one that is your password. Passwords that are simple and widely used are easily cracked.

## Findings ##
According to [NordPass](https://nordpass.com/most-common-passwords-list/) 2021 report.

1. The most common passwords globally are: 
* 123456
* 123456789
* 12345
* qwerty
* password
* 12345678
* 111111
* 123123
* 1234567890
* 1234567

2. Password choices are often attached to cultural preferences. For example,
 
* In the UK, “liverpool” was the third most popular password, with 224,160 hits
* In Chile,the name of Chilean football club “colocolo” was used by 15,748 people - making it the fifth most common choice
* “christ” was the 19th most common password used in Nigeria, used 7,169 times
* “bismillah”, an Arabic phrase meaning in the name of Allah, was used by 1,599 people in Saudi Arabia – the 30th most common choice.


## Activity 1.2 - How secure is my password? ## 
Aim - to learn which password combinations are the hardest to guess or crack.

* Launch this site to see [How Secure is your Password?](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/).
* Enter a password of your choice to see the result.
* Begin to use increasingly complex passwords (length and variation of characters) and see how the time frame changes. 
* For example, try the following passwords:
   - chocolate
   - chocolatemilkshake
   - Ch0c0l@t3
   - Ch0c0l@t3M1lksh@k3!
   
Use the [Paddlet link](https://yorksj.padlet.org/ausman3/jewean593fvgbgqu) to post your answers to the following questions. The password for the Paddlet is mYdOGISBigenough@89.

* i. Strong passwords can be difficult to remember. What can you do to avoid forgetting them?
* ii. When it’s time to change your password, what’s the best way to choose a new one?
* iii. How long would it take an attacker to crack a 10 character password?
* iv. Now that you are an expert, choose the strongest password from this list:
  - A. Monkey2
  - B. M0nk3y1
  - C. ThEM(12)nkEy~Eats@BAnEnahs
  - D. Th3 m0nk3y 3475 b4n4n4s

## Activity 1.3 - Design the strongest passphrase ##

* Write an easy-to-remember statement. This could be a lyric from a song or a scene from a movie, a narrative about a place you've visited, or any other phrase you recall. See the following example.
  - "The cat is Milo and the dog is Otis".
  - Now, take the first letter from each word to make your password (including capitalisation). E.g. TciMatdiO
  - Change the letters to numbers and symbols where possible. E.g. Tc1M&td10
  - You Can also add a symbol on the end for extra length and complexity. E.g. Tc1M&td10!

* Use the link [How Secure Is My Password?](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/) to see how secure the password you created is?
