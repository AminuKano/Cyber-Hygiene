# What is Cyber Hygiene ?
Cyber hygiene is the practice of using computer systems and other technological devices to maintain computer system health, keep data safe and well-protected, and improve online security. This could involve a routine to ensure identity safety â€“ such as using different passwords for accounts or just a general awareness of potential threats while using technology. 

Having good cyber hygiene is important not only to maintain the health of your system to make sure it runs quickly and smoothly but also to protect it from nefarious means such as viruses, malware, and your personal privacy and data. Cyber hygiene is also important to the users to protect accounts from hackers and thieves from accessing your data, social media accounts, or other vital accounts such as banking.
