# What is Cyber Hygiene ?
Cyber hygiene is the practice of using computer systems and other technological devices to maintain computer system health, keep data safe and well-protected, and improve online security. This could involve a routine to ensure identity safety – such as using different passwords for accounts or just a general awareness of potential threats while using technology. 

Having good cyber hygiene is important not only to maintain the health of your system to make sure it runs quickly and smoothly but also to protect it from nefarious means such as viruses, malware, and your personal privacy and data. Cyber hygiene is also important to the users to protect accounts from hackers and thieves from accessing your data, social media accounts, or other vital accounts such as banking.

* Make regular backups of data, in the case of data being lost or corrupted it can always be recovered from a backup.

* Update your software regularly 

* Avoid accessing public Wi-Fi. Remember, whenever you connect your device to the Internet, you are at the mercy of the network owner. The person who owns the internet gateway can successfully filter your internet traffic and subsequently exploit your device through different forms of attacks.

* Verify the wireless connection, do not just rely on names - Some bogus links — that have been set up by malicious users — will have a connection name that’s deliberately similar to the coffee shop, hotel or venue that’s offering free W - i-Fi.

* Avoid using specific types of websites – When using public Wi-Fi, it’s a good idea to avoid logging into websites where cybercriminals could capture your identity, passwords or personal information — such as social networking sites, online banking services or any websites that store your credit card information.

# Checking if your email has been a part of a data breach
One growing concern, in the realm of cyber hygiene is knowing when you've been a part of a data breach. Recently there has been a surge of companies having their databases breached; stealing all the users account details and data. From these details, hackers will use the breached data and attempt to sign into other services with the same details – hence it is important to use different passwords and enable two-factor authentication on all accounts.

The following site will show if your email address has been apart of any data breaches:
