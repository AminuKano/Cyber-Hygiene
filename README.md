# Cyber Hygiene


## Overview of the session 

* This session will train and engage partcipants to think proactively about cybersecurity, cyber threats, cybercrimes and impprove their understanding of online security. 
   - Students will participate in a discussion about social engineering and the best tools and approaches for maintaining cyber hygiene.
   - General methods and practices of keeping safe and secure online.
   - Methods of detecting and reporting cyber harassment. 
   
* Partcipants will also perform some exercises using specialised equipment for various cyber hygiene activities including:
     - Understanding keystroke injection attacks to execute payloads into network systems.
     - Observing user keystrokes by attacking and monitoring keyboard inputs.
